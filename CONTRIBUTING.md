# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/mthahzan/react-native-image-fallback/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Make sure to follow the coding conventions used throughout the project (indentation, comments, etc.). The pre-commit hook will notify you if there are any other issues.
